<p>Syracuse, N.Y.(JNL 211)- The allure of fast fashion lies in its trend-driven clothing offered at affordable prices. These items are often made with low-quality materials and produced at a rapid pace. However, beneath this convenience the rise of fast fashion is closely tied with environmental waste and is a reflection of the economy's impact on financial choices. </p>


<p>Fast fashion has a significant impact on the environment and continues to do so despite many attempts from organizations enforcing the recycling of clothes. According to the <a href=" https://dec.ny.gov/environmental-protection/recycling-composting/more-things-you-can-recycle/textile-reuse-recycling#:~:text=But%20did%20you%20know%20that%20every%20year,linens%20that%20could%20be%20reused%20or%20recycled" >New York State Department of Conservation </a> residents and businesses in New York State disposed of around 1.4 billion pounds of textiles annually. Alarmingly, Onondaga County contributed to the recycling of only 1% of textiles, reporting around 4,000 tons recycled in the last year. The Onondaga County Resource Recovery Agency (OCRRA), a non-profit organization established by the New York State Legislature, manages waste and recycling for Onondaga County’s residents. The agency oversees many programs such as curbside recycling, composting, hazardous waste collection, and waste-to-energy conversion. They aim to protect and conserve the environment by promoting waste reduction, material reuse, and responsible recycling practices. Despite their attempts with recycling, the chart below shows an inconsistency of the amount of textiles being recycled. Throughout 2020-2023 there seemed to be an increasing trend but, in 2024 this dropped significantly by thousands.

<h3> Popular Fast Fashion markets </h3>
<p>
As of May of this year, the popular fast fashion store, Forever 21 has filed for its second bankruptcy and is in the process of closing all of its U.S. stores, along with their location at Destiny Mall. A former Forever 21 worker, Merveille Bollou says that she felt as though she was replacing the shelves with new clothes almost every month. What once was the current trend would quickly appear on the sale rack. While in-person stores are shutting down, the company still holds a significant presence internationally and online and will now be under Authentic Brands Group, who is planning an upcoming collab with another fast fashion company, Shein. Recently, Edikted,a popular clothing brand, announced their east coast college tour with one of the schools being Syracuse University and arrived at Syracuse in late April. This pop-up event was very successful as hundreds of SU students lined up to receive free items and gift cards. Edikted is a popular fast fashion brand that adheres to the latest fashion trends at affordable prices. Although it is more expensive than stores like Shein and H and M, the popularity of the store overtakes it. On a closer glance, <a href="https://edikted.com/pages/sustainability?__ptLanguage=en-US&srsltid=AfmBOoo3bq9Cm2ce7a9TYuwKBidE4JNNWuNNEFZlyjD31nXi4JUVijc7 ">Edikted’s mission</a>is to merge style with sustainability by minimizing their carbon footprint. They use eco-friendly packaging and waste reduction practices such as producing only a certain number of items and responding accordingly with customer demands, selling sample sales to customers rather than throwing them into the landfill, and enforcing a paper-free policy. Despite claiming that they try to minimize waste, consumers are constantly getting rid of their Edikted clothing items due to being out of style, considering the name “fast fashion”. After selling out of popular clothing items, consumers no longer want to wear them after new trends come, leading to them either being thrown out or never worn again.

<p>
  Syracuse, has a median household income of around $45,000 with over 13,600 kids living below the <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/news/2024/12/syracuse-has-nations-worst-child-poverty-rate-we-dont-want-to-be-first-for-that.html ">poverty line.</a>With Syracuse’s high economic and environmental challenges, many families face financial constraints that influence their spending habits. While various stores may appear to offer economic relief with affordable pricing, the items people are purchasing are poor quality and often lead to a shorter lifespan. The cycle of frequent purchasing contributes to an increase of waste as well as expenses overtime. This leads to low income individuals spending more money on everyday items than they expected to.

<h3> Environmental Impacts of Fast Fashion </h3>
<p>
  Textile waste is a growing concern in New York State and the lack of awareness and infrastructure to support textile recycling is difficult. Recycling waste falls in the hands of local governments and tax payers and in this case, Syracuse must put more funds into the associated costs of recycling. This includes, transporting, sorting, and processing materials which may be difficult when other essential sources are in need of significant financial assistance as well. Although some organizations offer donation opportunities many community members do not seem to understand the overall environmental impacts. 
</p>

<p>
  As the world’s consumption habits continue to accelerate with the rise of fast fashion, landfills are increasing and continuing to damage our environment. Greenhouse gasses are often emitted from landfills, particularly methane. Methane comes from organic waste and decomposed textiles. It is 25 times stronger than carbon dioxide in trapping heat in the atmosphere. While we live in a world with modern technology, some landfills are able to capture this gas and use it for energy but, some infrastructure’s across New York are not capable of this. Landfills also contribute to soil and groundwater quality, generating a toxic liquid, leachate, to form as waste breaks down. This liquid contains hazardous chemicals, heavy metals, and Pathogens that may seep into the soil. 

</p>

<p> The rise of fast fashion has created a cycle of over consumption driven by economic pressures that has clearly impacted the Syracuse community. The frequent purchasing and disposal of fast fashion items have contributed to the growing landfills that harm our environment.  The lack of financial sustainability and awareness in Onondaga county needs to be addressed in order for progress to start showing. While Syracuse and its community have made several attempts to reduce waste, more exposure is needed in areas like churches, schools, and recreational buildings so that it can reach as many families as possible.
